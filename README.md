# Quantum White Blood Cell Classification + Equilibrium Propagation

This project implements **dual computational approaches** for white blood cell classification: **Quantum Ising Models** and **Equilibrium Propagation**. Both methods distinguish between healthy cells and those affected by Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), providing a comprehensive comparison between quantum computing and energy-based learning for automated medical diagnostics.

## Medical Context

The human immune system must constantly identify what belongs in the body versus what is foreign or abnormal. When white blood cells become cancerous (as in AML), they develop irregular morphological features that can be detected through microscopy. This project automates that detection process using **two cutting-edge computational paradigms**:

- üîÆ **Quantum Computing**: Leveraging superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference
- üß† **Equilibrium Propagation**: Using energy-based learning with biologically-inspired dynamics

### Microscopy and Cell Imaging
The datasets used contain high-resolution microscopy images captured using:
- Oil immersion lenses for enhanced magnification and optical pathway optimization
- Specialized dyes that bind to different cellular components to make transparent cells visible
- 100x magnification with expert-level image quality from clinical laboratories

These imaging techniques reveal the morphological differences between healthy and malignant white blood cells that originate from bone marrow and enter the bloodstream.
