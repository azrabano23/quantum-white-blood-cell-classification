# Quantum White Blood Cell Classification

This project uses a quantum Ising model to classify white blood cells, distinguishing between healthy cells and those affected by Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The system addresses the critical medical challenge of identifying abnormal cells that the immune system should recognize as foreign while avoiding misclassification of healthy cells.

## Medical Context

The human immune system must constantly identify what belongs in the body versus what is foreign or abnormal. When white blood cells become cancerous (as in AML), they develop irregular morphological features that can be detected through microscopy. This project automates that detection process using quantum computing principles.

### Microscopy and Cell Imaging
The datasets used contain high-resolution microscopy images captured using:
- Oil immersion lenses for enhanced magnification and optical pathway optimization
- Specialized dyes that bind to different cellular components to make transparent cells visible
- 100x magnification with expert-level image quality from clinical laboratories

These imaging techniques reveal the morphological differences between healthy and malignant white blood cells that originate from bone marrow and enter the bloodstream.
